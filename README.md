## Description

AnswerFlow is an online platform aimed at fostering a community among students and graduates of Computer Systems Engineering at a specific university. In response to the ever-evolving fields of college subjects, programming, and technological development, AnswerFlow serves as a knowledge-sharing refuge, saving time and money while breaking geographical barriers. 

This project addresses common obstacles like the lack of confidence in general Q&A applications, catering specifically to Palestinian programmers and university students. It offers a free alternative to paid apps, prioritizes user-friendly features, and encourages active participation, all within an agile development framework to streamline the platform's efficiency. 

AnswerFlow's core objectives include facilitating collaborative knowledge exchange, reducing the time and effort needed to find accurate answers, and creating an interactive space for learning and experience sharing.

## Frontend Repository

For the frontend of this project, visit the [AnswerFlow Frontend Repository](https://github.com/Mo7ammadAbuSafat/AnswerFlow-ReactJs).

## Database

The AnswerFlow backend uses SQL Server as the database management system. Below is an overview of the database schema structure.

This schema supports the core functionality of AnswerFlow.


## Technologies Used

- **.NET Core API**: The backend is built using .NET Core, providing a robust foundation for building web APIs.
- **AutoMapper**: AutoMapper is utilized for mapping data transfer objects (DTOs) between the API and frontend models.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: The API implements authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to different routes based on user roles.
- **Global Exceptions**: Comprehensive global exception handling is in place to manage and respond to errors gracefully.
- **RESTful API**: The backend follows RESTful API design principles, providing a standardized and predictable way to access resources.
- **Layered Architecture**: The project is structured with a layered architecture for better code organization and maintainability.
- **Cloudinary Service**: Cloudinary is used for managing and serving images and media files in the API.
- **API Requests**: The backend makes API requests to fulfill various functionalities, such as cloudinary service integration and communication with the frontend.

These technologies empower the AnswerFlow backend to deliver a secure and efficient web API.

Now, we'll proceed with adding content to the "Features" section in both the frontend and backend README files.
